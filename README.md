## What This Site Offers

This guide provides detailed optimization instructions to help you get the best possible performance in Smite, including:

### In-Game Settings
- Recommended graphics settings with visual references
- Optimal configurations for competitive play

### System Optimizations
- **Shader Cache Management** - Instructions for clearing shader cache on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs
- **Resizable BAR** - How to enable Resizable BAR in your BIOS for improved performance
- **RAM Overclocking** - Enabling XMP/DOCP profiles for faster memory speeds
- **CPU Overclocking** - Safe overclocking methods for both AMD and Intel processors
- **Network Optimization** - Using ExitLag to reduce ping and improve connection stability
- **Windows Configuration** - Power plan settings and driver update management

### Performance Expectations

Smite has notoriously poor optimization. Even with top-tier hardware (RTX 5090, etc.), you won't achieve the FPS you'd expect compared to other games. With these optimizations on a high-end system, you can expect around 200-250 FPS.

## Important Notes

- **Shader cache must be cleared when the game is shut down** for optimal performance
- These settings are based on real-world testing on high-end hardware
- Individual results may vary depending on your specific system configuration
